# final_project
final project :
this project aims to create an app for face recognition .

Steps:
1)- importing data from lwf or celebA, i imported data randomly because of virus problems
2)- making coding for preparation photos, embedding images, stocking embeddings, and creating user interface using different sources like: openface, faiss and so one.
3)- creating the user interface with streamlit which is based on github where there are all files and the tools we need to work with.
4)- creating the application and bravo: congratulations.

files:
1. READ.ME: this actual page.
2. appy.py: the most important one because it contains the codes to build the app.
3. images.zip : contains five random photos imported from lfw.
4. index.faiss and mon_model are just suffixes but they play an important role.
5. requirements which is the second important page beacause it contains all necessary packages and dependencies we need for.
requirements:
opencv-python-headless
facenet-pytorch
torch
faiss-cpu
tensorflow
streamlit
Pillow
numpy

###result :
unfortunately, i failed in building the user interface and the time is over but i am happy when learning and developing hard skill which is : machine learning .
